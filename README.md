# dhaqsoPay

**Test payments effortlessly, build confidently.**

## Project Overview

**dhaqsoPay** is an open-source project designed to solve a common problem faced by students and developers: the lack of a simple, reliable payment service for testing purposes. Our goal is to provide a robust payment testing solution, allowing users to test their systems before integrating with real payment APIs.

## Features

- **API for Payment Simulations**: Mock payment endpoints to simulate various scenarios (successful payments, failed payments, refunds).
- **Browser Extension**: A user-friendly extension that allows developers to test payments directly from their browsers.
- **NPM/PIP Package**: An easy-to-use package for integrating the testing system into development workflows.
- **Sandbox Environment**: Safely test your payment flows in a controlled environment.
- **Detailed Logs and Reports**: Get insights into your payment flow with comprehensive logs.
